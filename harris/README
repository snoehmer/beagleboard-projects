Implementation of a Harris corner detector

can be built in different ways:

 - simple build: builds the HCD for the host architecture (default)
                 invoked with "make" or "make HarrisCornerDetector"
                 
 - ARM only build: builds the HCD using an ARM cross compiler for an ARM target
                   invoked with "make HarrisCornerDetectorARM"
                   
 - ARM/DSP build: builds the HCD main code using an ARM cross compiler
                  builds optimized code for the DSP using TI'S code generation tools
                  invoked with "make HarrisCornerDetectorDSP"
                  not yet finished!
